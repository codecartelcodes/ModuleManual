# **Module Overview**

**Module**  
A “Module” is a business that provides Internet marketing, sales, and customer support.   
The Module also serves as a virtual call center. The day to day business operations and services that the Module sells are defined and detailed in the Manual. A small team works to complete the tasks on the Manual. 

**Manual**  
The Manual is the detailed project management plan to start and manage a Module business. The plan includes phases that contain stages. The stages contain the detailed tasks. Each task defines the who, what, when, where, why, and how details. In a sense, the Manual should be considered “the boss” of the business. All stakeholders work to improve the quality and accuracy of the Manual democratically. The Manual dictates the sequence in the way the tasks are completed; It is a sequenced backlog. This way, the team can focus on completing all the tasks on the Manual from the top to bottom. As new ideas for tasks are suggested by the team, the tasks are added to the Manual in the correct sequential order. The tasks are sequenced in an effort to maintain the “Black Financial Model”.

**Mode**
The Mode is the modus operandi

**Model**  
The Model is the “Black Financial Model” It mitigates the risk of “running in the red” by avoiding debt, bankruptcy, raising funds, upfront expenses, and costs that are not directly tied to sales. The idea is simple: income \- cost \= profit (where cost includes time, effort, money, knowledge and anything required to make a profit). When creating a business plan, a significant amount of time should be spent on challenging necessity of the costs and eliminating them whenever possible.   
For example, the black financial model philosophy applies especially to programming new software. Many entrepreneurs create elaborate plans to make (over) a million dollars by creating elaborate enterprise class software that requires at least a million lines of code. Instead, they should think critically about how to make the first million dollars with less than 10,000 lines of code and without having to raise capital or get approved for loans.

**Mentor**  
The Mentor has completed the tasks on the Manual and therefore is qualified to advise and support the Manager of the Module.

**Manager**  
The Manager is the *owner* of a Module and is responsible for making sure the tasks on the Manual are completed. First, the Manager gets hands-on experience and training by working alone to complete the tasks up to the “Pass the Test” stage. The Manager recruits, interviews, hires,  manages, and pays the Marketers and Motivators. The Manager also has administrator rights of all of the software systems.

**Marketers**  
A Marketer is an individual or company that runs one of the marketing campaigns listed and defined by the Manual. The fundamental purpose of the marketing campaigns is to generate highly qualified inbound leads. The marketing campaigns result in potential customers filling out a form with their contact name, email, and phone number.

**Motivators**  
A Motivator is responsible for calling pre-qualified inbound leads, selling the services of the Module, and motivating Members “complete the steps” in a multi-user sales funnel website.

**Members**  
A Member pays membership fee and works to complete the steps in the Method website.

**Method**  
The Method is a step-by-step multi-user sales funnel website that serves the Members.  
The Module will likely make more profit by selling SaaS (i.e. a fully-automated service).  
The Method can be “any service” the Module sells as long as it fits the financial Model.

**MoneyService**  
The MoneyService is a microservice that handles payments and refunds between the Member and the Module. The MoneyService also includes a marketing website for the Module.
