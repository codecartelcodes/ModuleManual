                Surveys
                find the best people in
                these markets and learn from them.
                Step 4: The final step is to develop a sales culture. As a sales manager, you are in a prime position to influence the culture of your team, mostly by how you behave as a manager. In short, your behaviour must signal that you endorse excellence and that you hold your team accountable; this will breed the type of culture that serves you best.
                The endorsement of excellence is best communicated by allocating most of your time and effort to mentoring those of your sales team who are performing the best, since they most likely have the characteristics to excel. To some, this may sound counterintuitive since sales staff who are underperforming are more likely to ask for help. However, high performing members of your sales team need to and want to be challenged and because they are more valuable to your company than underperformers, they should be your priority.
