PMBOK Process List
    The Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK) Guide outlines 47 processes distributed across 10 knowledge areas and 5 process groups. These processes are essential for project management success and are detailed in the PMBOK Guide 5th edition. Here is a brief overview of the processes and their distribution:

    Project Integration Management: 6 processes
    Project Scope Management: 5 processes
    Project Schedule Management: 6 processes
    Project Cost Management: 4 processes
    Project Quality Management: 3 processes
    Project Resource Management: 4 processes
    Project Communications Management: 3 processes
    Project Risk Management: 6 processes
    Project Procurement Management: 4 processes
    Project Stakeholder Management: 4 processes
    The processes are categorized into the following process groups:

    Initiating: 2 processes
    Planning: 24 processes
    Executing: 10 processes
    Monitoring and Controlling: 12 processes
    Closing: 1 process
    For memorization, it's recommended to focus on key words such as "Plan," "Estimate," "Perform," "Develop," "Control," "Identify," "Define," "Manage," "Validate," and "Close," as these words can help you associate each process with its corresponding process group and knowledge area.

    According to the PMBOK Guide, there are five process groups for every project life cycle: the initiating process group, planning process group, executing process group, monitoring and controlling process group, and lastly, the closing process group.
